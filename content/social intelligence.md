# On Writing

This is an interesting idea. It appears to me that the various rhetorical devices can be used to enhance the impact of something that is being said. There's this idea, that you can. When writing for horror and disturbing materials, the subject matter in itself can be quite jarring, and because of it's jarring nature, it makes it difficult for a person consuming the material to progress through it. Right. It is almost like a knife trying to cut through blocks of concrete, it's like a sawing action. You want the consumption of the material to be like butter, or a hot knife going through butter.

We can use rhetorical devices to get that effect. The way it might look, is that uhm, you can say the most revolting things but if you then wrap it up in alliteration and various different thetorical devices and then maybe you can make the material a lot easier to consume.
